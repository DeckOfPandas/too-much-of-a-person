quotation: "When I was 19 I went through a very very deep depression and I was diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is so vague and it chimes a lot with sociopathy and childhood trauma. It's hard because the way that borderline people are portrayed in movies...well we're very ill portrayed. We usually are the bad guys that don't know how to behave ourselves and the thing you need to know is that a lot of borderline people don't hurt the people around them they hurt themselves. I think that as a woman who has been having mental health issues since she was 15 you get silenced a lot. And I didn't want that to define me so I just kept quiet. "
