quotation: "I came from a very strong feminine line and my grandma and mother were very powerful women and still are. It was just so natural they would say 'Do what you want to do. You are the best at what you are doing. Don't compare yourself to anyone else just to yourself: who you were yesterday, or a year ago or a week ago. Be the best version of yourself and always grow. Be independent of other people, circumstances, opinions, gossip. These things will always be in your life–it's human nature–but it is up to you to not react. Just rise above."
short_quotation: "I really don't care what you think about me because I don't think about you at all."
