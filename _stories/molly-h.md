quotation: "From a young age, I felt my body wasn't mine. There was harassment at college. Slapped on the bum, groped, your stuff stolen and boys would put their genitals on it. And when we brought it up all people could say was 'Oh, you know, horny teenage boys.' Well excuse me, I'm a teenage girl and I have hormones as well but I'm not going around touching and groping people inappropriately."
short_quotation: "Why do I always feel as though I am living under this male gaze and that I am being consumed? It's relentless. My rage is real."
