quotation: "I grew up learning that and accepting myself. You have no choice if you want to be happy you have to be happy with yourself. You are going to chase a fairy and you are not going to find anything if you just chase happiness in the eyes of everybody else and not yours that's stupid you are going to continue to look for something that doesn't exist."
short_quotation: "I'm too loud when I laugh and I'm too loud when I fuck."
