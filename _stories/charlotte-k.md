quotation: "People have said I talked too loudly and it was if as a girl I could not take too much space. If you are a boy surrounded by girls and you are talking very loudly and laughing loudly you are perceived as a “funny man”. As a girl it is very different. People say “What is she looking for? Does she want everybody to look at her? Is she flirting?”"
short_quotation: "As a girl I was told 'you cannot take up too much space' and 'you talk too much'."
