quotation: "“Even my female colleagues thought that a girl being sexually harassed was ‘just a guy being annoying’. Even harassment was too big of a word for what it was apparently. They thought the girl was ‘too weak’ to defend herself. Maybe it’s so natural for people to see harassment of women they deny it.”"
short_quotation: "Being sensitive isn't bad. You can laugh at a little thing you feel the way you feel. It's good to question yourself but it is also good to know how it feels right for you. Be your too much. It's important to listen to yourself."
