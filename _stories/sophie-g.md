quotation: "Coming to work and wanting to do a job and not smiling at my desk. Oh she’s so upset, are you OK? Immediately, it's my private life or my emotions that people go to rather than, I'm just being serious sitting at my desk doing my job. Why do I have to have this smile on my face and be chit chatty and cutesy for you? If a man comes into the office and he is like, ‘business, business, business’, would anyone ask him, ‘you're not your usual chirpy self today?’ You just wouldn't dare, it wouldn’t cross your mind."
