quotation: "I'm fearless.  I've been called #toomuch my whole life.  No friends of mine would judge me for anything I've done, anything I've been through or anything I feel."
short_quotation: "I'm too much by society's standards but I feel like they're too little and I'm tired letting people who don't have the balls to live their lives to the fullest tell me that I'm not good enough because they are too small."
