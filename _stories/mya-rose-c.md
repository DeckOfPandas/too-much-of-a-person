quotation: "They say I'm too young and I don't know what I'm talking about. As I got older and used it to it, I got more angry with it, I realised that it's nothing to do with me and it was because they couldn't cope with me having a voice and it wasn't about me having too much of something, it was them having too little. Makes life a lot more pleasant when you like yourself. "
short_quotation: "I think our system is completely structured to quieten girls and empower boys - this gives teenage boys a massive advantage as they have confidence from a very early age"
