quotation: "I know that I am quite intense and chatty, and perhaps even controlling. It's quite a good way of sifting for friends because people who understand that, without it even being brought up, they are some of my closest friends. For people for who this needs to be negotiated constantly I tend to shy away from unless my bond to them is very strong in other ways. I think being called too much has been great for molding my character and actually finding strength in who I am.   I've been called 'very sure of myself', especially if it seems like I don't care what people think of me. Society has taught women to retreat a bit and gender plays a role how much space we take up."
