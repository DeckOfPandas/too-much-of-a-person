quotation: "We need a lot more acceptance of everything, rather than constantly trying to change things and fix things, and makes things better, just to say it is how it is...I see a lot of cultural norms around how people should be or 'what is the best way to be a person' and the more I look into it, everything has positives and negatives, very single behaviour you can have or do has positives and negatives..."
short_quotation: "Every single behavior you can have or do has positives and negativesâ€¦Get out there and be too much!"
