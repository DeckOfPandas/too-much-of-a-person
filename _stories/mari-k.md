quotation: "I love that I love dancing. Me comes out the most when I'm on stage. I love that when I'm on stage I can just be who I am. It doesn't matter whatever they call me because on stage no one can tell you anything. I can just be free and pour out my passion to the audience and that’s what I love doing and that’s why it’s my job."
