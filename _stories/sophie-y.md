quotation: "In terms of talking too much about my personal experiences, my relationships, I definitely think that this has been a massive empowering thing for me. It's been so empowering to have my story and turn it into something good and own the narrative around it as well. Tell it on my own terms and not listen to everyone who has said negative things about it. It is powerful in the impact it can have on other people, but then it has been so powerful for myself and massively therapeutic and it's given me a voice which I felt that I shouldn't have before or didn't have. And if I wasn't talking about it I don't know how I would feel about the whole thing and I don't know if I'd be like so happy and accepting of what happened as I am now."
