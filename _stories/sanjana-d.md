quotation: " 'I was told I'm 'too black'. That was something I was told at school.'Oh you're being too black' I suppose in the sense of how I carried myself. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. You are who you are. Culture and diversity is not always accepted and people judge you according to stereotypes. I'm happy with being from a background which is Black British and Carribean.'// "
short_quotation: "Next time someone is doing well instead of bringing them down pull them up, let them grow and they will help you too. "
