quotation: "People like what they knowâ€“it's easier. It's a very human reaction. It comes from a place of fear, insecurity and a lack of imagination. If you think I'm too much maybe you don't think you're enough."
short_quotation: "My own best friend said: 'You know you are going to die alone if you don't stop being you'. I was like 'here's hoping'.
