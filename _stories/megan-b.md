quotation: "I get the feeling some people think I am being too much by talking about endometriosis openly and often. But, if we don't talk about it, things won't change. I'm passionate about spreading the message of endometriosis because if more people know about it then it can be caught earlier and cause less damage. "
short_quotation: "Oh Megan's sensitive but I'll try not to show it to them but I'll feel it inside."
