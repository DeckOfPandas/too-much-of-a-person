quotation: "When I was in my teens I came across this scripture and it blew my mind: The new testament, the book of Galatians, Paul 'Am I now a servant of people or a servant to God? If I am now trying to serve and please people then I am not a servant of God.'"
short_quotation: "I think where some people get it wrong is making you feel bad for how you are, rather than encouraging you for sort of becoming a better version of yourself."
