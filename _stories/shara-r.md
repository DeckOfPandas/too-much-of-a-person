quotation: "Advice to 13 year old self: You are only one of you so don't fall into the trap of following what everyone else is trying to do, especially now with social media, there's so much pressure. Please be yourself because that's what makes you so beautiful. It's important to have individuality as that is what shapes you."
short_quotation: "I am that I've got my PHD, if anything, if anyone is going to take me seriously it's because of that, that's my weapon. Wherever I end up I've still got my education and something to be proud of."
