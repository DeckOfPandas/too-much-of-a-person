quotation: "In my culture divorce is not as much as a taboo with Somalian women if you're not happy with the guy you can leave. One thing I learnt being around certain women is if you get married make sure you know who you are outside of that title, of the wife, because after a while you are just known as the wife, so and so's wife, the mum of x, y, z. I need to provide for myself before I'm ready. There aren't a lot of advantages for women in marriage."
short_quotation: "Things like science, that supposed to be objective and grounded in research and numbers and everything, are still influenced by certain attitudes. Patriarchy is mad!"
