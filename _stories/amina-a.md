quotation: "In my culture divorce is not as much as a taboo. With Somalian women, if you're not happy with the guy then you can leave. One thing I learnt being around certain women is that if you get married make sure you know who you are outside of that title of 'the wife', because after a while you are just known as the wife, so and so's wife, the mum of x, y, z. I need to provide for myself before I'm ready. There aren't a lot of advantages for women in marriage."
short_quotation: "Things like science, that supposed to be objective and grounded in research and numbers and everything, are still influenced by certain attitudes. Patriarchy is mad!"
