quotation: "I was close to two other girls at work and they both happened to be black girls. And there were complaints made about us because we used to sit together, work together and we used to laugh and things like that. We weren't doing anything horrible, we weren't talking about anyone but there were people who felt intimidated by that. It was really awful and I thought in this day and age why are we being told that we can't sit together and we're being cliquey? Just because we are three young black girls together. You just feel like you are too much."
short_quotation: "As you get older you start to care less about what other people think and more about how things are affecting your mind and your happiness."
