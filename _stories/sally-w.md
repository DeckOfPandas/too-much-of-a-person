quotation: "It takes a lot. I would stand up and commend any woman who will stand up and fight and talk. It made me appreciate women even more, especially if we are talking about the suffragettes and it being 100 years and just thinking what they did at that time and what they had against them. And I feel around the area of domestic abuse, what they went through, they did it, they made the way for us, but we are still going through certain things that where the exact same things that they fought for."
