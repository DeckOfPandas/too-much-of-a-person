quotation: "Growing up I always felt I was too tall, too big, too fat. I missed out on so many things because I hated my body. Then as an adult, there have been times I've feared that I'm too opinionated, too loud, too tactile, too colourful! But these parts of ourselves, the ones we feel we have to hide or change, they're what make us who we are. We have to stop trying to fit ourselves into the boxes society says we have to fit in, especially as women. Be loud, be quiet, be 'out there', be whatever you want to be! No one is too much. And I'm not too much. I am who I am - and I'm totally ok with that"
