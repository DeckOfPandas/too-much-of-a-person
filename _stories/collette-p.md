quotation: "When I was a kid, I was told I was too quiet all of the time, especially at school.  Because when you are quiet you miss out on opportunities and doing stuff.  Me being quiet was never a positive.  In secondary school I had to find my voice to not be picked on. Then later on, in my advertising career, I was told I was too accommodating or too assertive to clients etc. but being assertive has been great for me in global roles outside of English politeness. People like you being direct. "
