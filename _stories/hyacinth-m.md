quotation: "A lot of the time we hold our voice in and we don't speak our truth because we are worried about hurting people and what they think. And I'm thinking it's good to be mindful but I'm actually 46 and I don't want to be muting my voice. The more I'm living my truth I'm finding it isn't hurting people. It's really liberating."
