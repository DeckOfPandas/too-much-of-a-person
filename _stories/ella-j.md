quotation: "Feminism in the 60s was very, very, very different from feminism today. And I think that these women, a lot of them were a lot older… they haven’t really evolved with their time. And they’re just seeing it as us just making a fuss and being spoilt with the way that we see the woman’s position in society, compared to what they had.” 
"
short_quotation: "You're right, you’re not a pain in the ass… These things that are a problem today will be your biggest strengths."
