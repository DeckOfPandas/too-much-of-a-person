quotation: "What is it worth? Is it worth to me, to live my life under the shadow of misogyny? It's not a question of freedom that's too easy. What is it worth? Is it worth to me, if I live my life under the influence of all the men around me? It's not a question of freedom that's too easy. And what can I do in this world as treacherous as the sea?"
short_quotation: "What do they expect? It's the same with 'too emotional' it makes you feel more emotional and it makes you feel ashamed.
