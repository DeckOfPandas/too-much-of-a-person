quotation: "One guy said I looked 'too fake'. It really shook me because up until that point I had really struggled with how I was looking. I had spent ages trying to get a wig exactly how I wanted it. It made me a little paranoid that my wig looked 'too wiggy'. Then I explained to him that I had alopecia but you know it still put it into my head 'Am I doing too much? Am I trying too hard to look normal?' But it was just his opinion. He was a complete stranger."
