quotation: "Too skinny', as long as you are happy who fucking cares. It's just, 'eat what the fuck you want'. The important thing is the relationship with food rather than the size of yourself, because I think there is such thing as being politically incorrect with bigger and also with skinnier. Women of the world, if somebody tells you you're 'too skinny', who the fuck cares as long as your relationship with food is good. "
