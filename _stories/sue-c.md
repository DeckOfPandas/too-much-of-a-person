quotation: "When I grew my hair, when I left home and grew my hair, lots of boyfriends said 'too much hair'. I'm thinking about hair as a secondary sexual symbol as well and when it's curly and big, it sort of a symbol, people criticise your hair but they don't mean your hair, they mean everything else's. They mean you're just taking up too much attention."
