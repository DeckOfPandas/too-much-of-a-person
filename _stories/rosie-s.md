quotation: "Too much for what? But for what? Too talkative for what, a library? Too outgoing for what? There's an implication there that there should be a middle ground, that I'm supposed to be at for something, but I'm not particularly unsuccessful at life because you're saying I'm too much of something, so does it matter? It's just an insult, rather than something constructive."
