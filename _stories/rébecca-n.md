quotation: "Small acts of kindness really matter. I think someone saying something nice to you, or if you are in a social situation and you start to feel very isolated, someone picks up on it, I think by someone smiling at you and asking if everything is ok, those are the small things that make a difference. I don't think it's going to make the world a perfect world because there is so much structural injustice and the system is rigged, but at least as human beings to be kind to each other, it would be better.
