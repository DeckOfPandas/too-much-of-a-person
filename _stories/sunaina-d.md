quotation: "It's a really shitty situation to be in when someone is basically just berating you for you being you. It's a crap feeling and usually if 'too' is attached to an adjective it's not in a complimentary manner. Even if it's 'too smart', you know? There will come a time when you realise 'I can only be me. This is who I am. If you're not OK with it you have the option to not be part of my life'. That is 100% your choice."
short_quotation: "You do you."
