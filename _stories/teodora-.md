quotation: "People are scared and when they see someone in full shine they are jealous. In Serbia you can see a lot of kind of people but they are all closed up and shy and they don't want to talk with 'other' people. They think oh my god they have tattoos and they are a junkies or a hooligan. If someone is wearing nice jeans or a top they will call them faggot. When a woman is too feminine they will rape her. "
