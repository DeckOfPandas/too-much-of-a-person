quotation: "I was often being told 'calm down' because I was getting 'too worked up' when I didn't agree with something, usually a social justice issue.  It happened a lot in my late teens and early twenties. Being told to 'calm down' frustrated me, made me feel I'm making a scene just by not agreeing with others."
