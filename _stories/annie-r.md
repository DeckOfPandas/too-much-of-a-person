quotation: "First time was like my first school I'm 'too different'.  It was the first time I started to doubt myself. I did have people being overtly racist towards me but it wasn't as insidious as the covert racism and being 'othered' and people running away from you.  "
short_quotation: "I believe as human beings we are all individual and all unique and that is our power and I think our power is taken away from us when we are forced to conform."
