quotation: "I used to have a Youtube channel about makeup when I was 12. I stopped it because it was 'too much' for the bullies at school. They created an entire Facebook group with the sole purpose of humiliating me. Do you know how much that channel could have been worth now? I had so many followers. I am a makeup artist now and I love colour and why would I not express myself?"
