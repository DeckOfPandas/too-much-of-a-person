quotation: "The way I'm too much, I feel, I'm told that I'm too emotional and too sensitive...I experience my emotions taken overdrive, and the way I control it, I bottle them and then I become too cold, as  I've been told, oscillating between too warm, too sensitive, and too cold. [I] try not to be too much of anything, which poses a problem for me because I am not myself."
short_quotation: "Whenever there’s a situation, just be brave and courageous and stand up for it…be yourself…just go for it…"
