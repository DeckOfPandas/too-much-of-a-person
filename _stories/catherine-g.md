quotation: "Women doing emotional labour is part of the culture that feeds into men, toxic masculinity. Some men almost expect women to do that. That's why they sing, write poems, stories, films and whatever about it and you're just sort of like we're not here to fix you. So when I say we need to unlearn that, I mean we - men and women - need to unlearn that."
