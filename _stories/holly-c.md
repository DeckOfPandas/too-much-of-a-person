short_quotation: "It's important to be able to say you are proud of your achievements//I have always been very aware of my body image and people think it's OK to say you are too fat too skinny too white too spotty. Basically anything that is outside of what society believes is beautiful.//I love that my body is strong and I have good posture and I love that my body allows me to do all the things I do every single day.//At school"
