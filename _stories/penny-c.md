quotation: "About identifying as non binary: It's hard to explain it to people, I think I've found it difficulty. I've been in a few situations where I've been in a sat with my family friends of friends at a pub, and I've tried to explain something and they're saying so, 'you don't know, you're confused, you don't know whether you're a boy or a girl, so you're transexual. And I said, I'm not transexual, I wouldn't say I'm transgender either as I don't feel like I want to be male. So there is some confusion around decisions// I think it's really tricky if you're not that as its not black or white. If you have to have a gender construct of 'man' 'woman', you're not picking and people can't digest or understand that. "
