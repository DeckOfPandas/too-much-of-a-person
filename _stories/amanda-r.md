quotation: "I was told I'm 'too black'. That was something I was told at school.'Oh you're being too black' I suppose in the sense of how I carried myself. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. You are who you are. Culture and diversity is not always accepted and people judge you according to stereotypes. I'm happy with being from a background which is Black British and Caribbean."
short_quotation: "One thing I know: you can only be yourself and express yourself the best you in a safe space. I suppose when you are in that safe space with the right people around you then those things that are perceived as negatives are then perceived as positives."
