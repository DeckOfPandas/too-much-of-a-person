quotation: "I was told I was 'too nice' and 'too honest' in a work situation. That left me confused as I can't see how that is a bad thing?'//Too black from guys who've said that and talk about what is acceptable aesthetically. I am open and honest and sometimes told i'm too sensitive in a relationship especially if something hurtful is said that I don't like. Mostly at school being told I was too nice.  It's all about human interactions.  You can only be who you are and how people perceive you is perhaps from their own experiences projecting onto you their own thoughts and feelings which is out of your control.  My mum and sister have always been supportive of me and who I am.//'Too needy' and then 'too independent' in relationships// 'I was told I'm 'too black'. That was something I was told at school.'Oh you're being too black' I suppose in the sense of how I carried myself. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. You are who you are. Culture and diversity is not always accepted and people judge you according to stereotypes. I'm happy with being from a background which is Black British and Caribbean.'// "
short_quotation: "One thing I know: you can only be yourself and express yourself the best you in a safe space. I suppose when you are in that safe space with the right people around you then those things that are perceived as negatives are then perceived as positives."
