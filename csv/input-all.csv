Adina,Stroia,2018,"I know that I am quite intense and chatty, and perhaps even controlling. It's quite a good way of sifting for friends because people who understand that, without it even being brought up, they are some of my closest friends. For people for who this needs to be negotiated constantly, I tend to shy away from unless my bond to them is very strong in other ways. I think being called too much has been great for molding my character and actually finding strength in who I am. I've been called 'very sure of myself', especially if it seems like I don't care what people think of me.

Ailie,Wallace,2018,"I've been called too slutty when I was sexually assaulted. It went round the whole school and I was called a slut. I had strangers in the street call me a slut and it followed me into my twenties and in the pubs I had these guys that I didn't even know calling me a slut. It is one of the worst names you can call someone I think. All those things were drummed into me over time and you start to doubt who you are and then change who you are to fit in with other people, especially as a teenager. After years of trying to change it got to the stage where I didn't even recognise myself anymore and that's when I started struggling with my mental health. It's only recently that I have gone back and rediscovered who I really am and not give a damn when I am too much for some people because it is their problem. I told a few close friends about the sexual assault and they didn't really react. That made me doubt myself. Over the years I have changed it in my mind to think well I must have been to blame or I must have been partly involved too. Only recently that I have been exploring that through counseling It seems ridiculous now that I was blaming myself especially when I was a teenager girl, I was 13. There is absolutely no way that I should have been blamed and I wish I had spoken out about it then. But I was too afraid and I didn't not want to be believed.",It's only recently that I have gone back and rediscovered who I really am and not give a damn when I am too much for some people because it is their problem.,https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/570071868%3F,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ip8F2EWcws,#toopassionate #toomanly #tooslutty

My brain couldn't compute with that too argumentative, when my intent was coming from a good place. I was only making a noise to be heard rather than to cause trouble. It made me feel really quite small and guilty. I've heard I'm too argumentative my whole life from my family.

I'm thinking about hair as a secondary sexual symbol as well and when it's curly and big, it sort of a symbol, people criticise your hair but they don't mean your hair, they mean everything else. They mean you're just taking up too much attention.","People criticise your hair but they don't mean your hair, they mean everything else.

Sunaina,Dasgupta,2018,"It's a really shitty situation to be in when someone is basically just berating you for you being you. It's a crap feeling and usually if 'too' is attached to an adjective it's not in a complimentary manner. Even if it's 'too smart', you know? There will come a time when you realise 'I can only be me. This is who I am. If you're not OK with it you have the option to not be part of my life'. That is 100% your choice.",You do you.,https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/569990961%3F,https://youtu.be/YDpZic6GLTo,https://www.youtube.com/embed/YDpZic6GLTo,#toosensitive #toomodern #toointimidating

Teodora,Savic,2018,"People are scared and when they see someone in full shine they are jealous. In Serbia you can see a lot of kind of people but they are all closed up and shy and they don't want to talk with ""other"" people. They think oh my god they have tattoos and they are a junkies or a hooligan. If someone is wearing nice jeans or a top they will call them faggot. When a woman is too feminine they will rape her.

Timea ,Lukacova,2018,"I'm told that I'm too emotional and too sensitive...I experience my emotions taken overdrive, and the way I control it, I bottle them and then I become too cold, as  I've been told, oscillating between too warm, too sensitive, and too cold.

Victoire,Vager,2018,"When I was 19, I went through a very very deep depression and I was diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is so vague and it chimes a lot with sociopathy and childhood trauma. It's hard because the way that borderline people are portrayed in movies...well, we're very ill portrayed. We usually are the bad guys that don't know how to behave ourselves and the thing you need to know is that a lot of borderline people don't hurt the people around them, they hurt themselves. I think that as a woman who has been having mental health issues since she was 15, you get silenced a lot. And I didn't want that to define me, so I just kept quiet.

Zoe,Cunningham,2018,"We need a lot more acceptance of everything rather than constantly trying to change things and fix things and makes things better, just to say it is how it is...I see a lot of cultural norms around how people should be or 'what is the best way to be a person' and the more I look into it, everything has positives and negatives.
