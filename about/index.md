	<p class="">Too Much of a Person is a new side project, and we're looking for those who identify as women or non-binary people to photograph who have been accused of being "too much" of something. Our idea is that that 'something' is really our power and, if we haven't done so already, to reclaim that, enjoy that, and be whatever the fuck we want.</p>
	<p>Welcome to the online gallery, where we share our stories of being called "too much" when a straight white man would have been praised. Listen to the powers and waves these extraordinary people are making in the world, and realise that you are not alone.</p>
	<p>We fight together and take up space together.</p>
