# Building locally 
### Initial setup for first local build
* `git clone` repo
* `bundle install` to install list in Gemfile  
* `npm install` to install list in packages.json  
* TODO Quick description of how to get bundler etc 

### Then
* `gulp serve` builds the site and serves it at `localhost:3000
* (The gulpfile has other build options, including `gulp clean`)
* Browser automaticlly refreshes with changes etc\

## Notes 
* Make sure `baseurl` and `url` are set up correctly for the main build:
```
baseurl: "/too-much-of-a-person"
url: "https://deckofpandas.github.io"
```
* Locally these settings will be something like:
```
baseurl: "/"
url: "http://localhost:3000/"
```
* I have included `_config.dev.yml` as well as `_config.yml` to cover this
