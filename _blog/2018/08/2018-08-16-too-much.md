Smile...but not that much  
You’re sending the wrong message  
Show off your curves...that’s too much!  
You don’t want to give the wrong image...  
  
  
Be strong and independent!  
But not so much your partner becomes redundant   
Be vocal and open minded  
But not too much in case they think you’re opinionated  
  
  
Be poised and elegant  
But just enough...  
Because being too much  
Would make you arrogant  
  
  
Have some food, you’re too thin!  
Not that much, you’ll get a double chin...  
Go talk to guys, don’t be a nun!  
But not too many...they’ll call you wanton  
  
  
Enough is enough  
And ‘Too Much’ is too much  
Yes, I was born woman  
But I am first of all human  
  
  
The truth is there is too much of me  
That you have yet to discover and see  
But if you put your fear and your pride aside   
You will realise that there is no part of me you’d ever want to hide
