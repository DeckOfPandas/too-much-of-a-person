Dearest Sunaina,

It‚Äôs me. Well actually, it‚Äôs just you, but from the future. You‚Äôll be delighted to know that you‚Äôve made it to the final year of your 20s and mostly achieved all the things you wanted to when you were a young girl. Unfortunately, making it on to the Forbes 30 under 30 list is not one of them.  

Anyway, today is International Girls Day (we have a day for everything in the future), I wanted to write to you all the things that you desperately needed to hear when you were a young girl. Here goes:    
 
  1. You‚Äôre not fat. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times Trisha tells you that you are - YOU‚ÄôRE NOT FAT. You don‚Äôt need to starve yourself. I know you don‚Äôt want to believe this, but it‚Äôs true. You‚Äôre going to look back at photos of yourself and wonder what made you crazy enough to think that you were the same size as an orca whale!

  2. Spend more time with your family and be nicer to them - especially your sister, you should really stop telling her she‚Äôs adopted. You‚Äôre going to miss them when you leave home. You only realise just how much mama and papa (but mostly mama) do for you, after you leave. No one is going to love you more than your family does.  

  3. Let go of the anger. You didn‚Äôt deserve what happened and it wasn‚Äôt your fault. You can‚Äôt control how other people act, you‚Äôre just a kid.  

  4. Stop stressing about what other people think of you- they seldom do. You‚Äôre going to read this as a quote at some point in the future and it‚Äôs going to make you feel incredibly liberated. Everyone is wrapped up in their own little world, and you should just do whatever you want to do. Write that sketch! Keep playing tennis/basketball!    

  5. Hold on to your little brother, Charlie, really tight and never let him go. Just. hold. on.   

Lots of unconditional love,  

An older and definitely not self-actualised version of you.

Hindsight is a gift. I asked several women - ‚ÄúIf you could give advice to your younger self, what would you say?‚Äù   

Here‚Äôs what they had to say:   

{% include blog_quotation_inline.html quotation_text="Your self worth and value is more than what people, especially guys, think of you. You can do what you want, as long as it's what you truly wanted to and not what you thought others did." quotation_attribution="Marie Toulemonde" %}  


{% include blog_quotation_inline.html quotation_text="Stop procrastinating, write the blog no matter how shitty, start the style blog, apply to a bunch of publishers" quotation_attribution="Avanti Malhotra" %}   


{% include blog_quotation_inline.html quotation_text="Study but it's not all about the final grade. Life doesn't end if it's not perfect (despite what the teachers said)" quotation_attribution="Laura Barnes"  %}  


{% include blog_quotation_inline.html quotation_text="Don't stress about guys üôà Use that energy to cultivate relationships with friends, family and most importantly yourself!" quotation_attribution="Alicia Hickey" %}

{% include blog_quotation_inline.html quotation_text="It is ok not to plan and overthink things. I would tell her to live in the moment and not worry too much about what is coming tomorrow, as as much as we'd like to know, the future is unpredictable" quotation_attribution="Nina Kerkez" %}  


{% include blog_quotation_inline.html quotation_text="Be more confident in yourself and don‚Äôt be scared to want things and go after them. Don‚Äôt get hung up on the details, see the bigger picture. Force yourself out of your comfort zone" quotation_attribution="Emily Graham" %}

{% include blog_quotation_inline.html quotation_text="You did the best you could with what you were given and you are going to live an exciting wonderful life very soon. You will see elephants and love fiercely and fly on a plane and paint huge oil paintings and swim like a mermaid and meet wonderful humans. Just you wait for that!" quotation_attribution="Diana Patient " %}
