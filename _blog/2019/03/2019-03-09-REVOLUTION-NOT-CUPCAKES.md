Happy International Women's Day!

We want revolution and not to be placated with cupcakes and capitalist sponsors selling us "feel-good feminism, that encourages women to invest in their aspirations, be empowered and 'lean in’” (Catherine Rottenberg, author of The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism).

Palatable and marketable feminism is non-threatening and "it doesn't address the devastation wrought by capitalism, misogyny and sexism" (Catherine Rottenberg, as above). 

So what do we want? 

At Too Much of a Person we asked 100 womxn and non-binary people in our interviews what a better world would look like, because once we have burnt down the patriarchy, what kind of world do we want to build from the ashes? 

Here is what our Too Much of a Person participants hope for:
